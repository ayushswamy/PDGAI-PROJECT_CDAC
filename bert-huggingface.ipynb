property and counter-accused the Gandhi family of having acquired a lot of assets over years with little-known sources.\n","PTI\n","NEW DELHI: Asserting that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has often donated his personal savings to public causes, the BJP Tuesday said he has always believed in the principle of \"simple living, high ideals\", as the saffron party slammed the Congress for accusing that he had given \"wrong information\" about a plot he owned in Gandhinagar.\n","The BJP said the Congress has levelled false allegations regarding Modi's property and counter-accused the Gandhi family of having acquired a lot of assets over years with little-known sources.\n","The Congress has in the past dismissed the BJP's charge of financial irregularities against the Gandhi family as false and has also termed action by probe agencies as political vendetta.\n","At a press conference, the Congress alleged on Tuesday Modi had declared in an election affidavit in 2007 that he was the sole owner of Plot 411 in Sector 1 of Gandhinagar, but omitted that information in his election affidavits afterwards and gave details of another piece of land.\n","\"In the light of discrepancies in the affidavit, the Congress party demands that the Election Commission of India takes thorough cognisance of the seemingly deliberate omissions in Modi's affidavit and take appropriate action under the Representation of People Act,\" Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said.\n","Putting up a strong defence of Modi, the ruling party said his life is an example of believing in \"simple living and high ideals\".\n","The BJP said Modi recently donated Rs 21 lakh from his personal savings to the welfare fund of sanitary employees during the ' Kumbh Mela '.\n","In 2014, Modi had donated a similar amount of money from his savings for the education of daughters of Gujarat government employees after he quit as the state's chief minister to take up the prime minister's post, it said.\n","The BJP said that the prime minister had donated USD 200,000, which he received on being conferred with Seoul Peace Prize , to \"Namami Gange\" project, aimed at cleaning the river.\n","He had also donated Rs 11.73 crore after auctioning various gifts he had received as prime minister, the BJP said.\n","Refuting the Congress allegation regarding the Gandhinagar plot, the BJP said four plots purchased by four different persons, including Modi, were amalgamated into one on April 25, 2008 and added that it is obvious that the number of the amalgamated plot is different from the separate individual numbers.\n","\"The caravan of falsehood moves on. There is a bankruptcy of issues in the Congress,\" it said.\n","A similar charge is made against Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, the BJP noted, saying, \"there is a limit to trivialisation\".

This decision was made public on Tuesday, just hours before the commencement of the 18th Lok Sabha. This marks a crucial moment in Indian politics as the opposition, led by Congress, prepares to challenge the ruling BJP-led NDA coalition.\n","\n","First Major Battle: Speaker Election\n","The first significant confrontation between the opposition and the NDA is set for the Speaker’s election. Traditionally, the Deputy Speaker position is given to an opposition member. However, lacking assurance on this tradition, Congress and the INDIA bloc have decided to contest the Speaker’s post. They have nominated K Suresh against the BJP’s candidate, Om Birla, who held the position in the previous Lok Sabha.Symbolic Yet Significant Contest\n","Although the election for the Speaker’s post might be largely symbolic, given the NDA’s simple majority with 293 MPs and additional support from the YSR Congress, it sends a strong message. The opposition aims to signal a shift in parliamentary dynamics compared to 2014 and 2019.\n","\n","Empowering the Opposition\n","Appointing Rahul Gandhi, a prominent figure in Congress, as the Leader of the Opposition is a strategic move. This is the first time since 2014 that an opposition party has met the 54-seat threshold required to claim the post. This position, which comes with cabinet rank, will allow Gandhi to effectively raise issues on behalf of the opposition and the INDIA bloc. These issues include the alleged leaks in various examinations, such as NEET-UG, and the controversial Agnipath scheme for Army recruitment.\n","\n","Role of the Leader of the Opposition\n","As the Leader of the Opposition, Rahul Gandhi will join key panels alongside the Prime Minister, such as those selecting Election Commissioners and the CBI director. This constitutional role also grants him the opportunity to engage with visiting heads of state, offering his perspective on national matters.\n","\n","Announcement of the Decision\n","The INDIA bloc’s floor leaders finalized the decision to appoint Rahul Gandhi during a meeting at Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge’s residence. KC Venugopal, a senior party leader, announced that Sonia Gandhi, the Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson, had written to Pro-Tem Speaker Bhartruhari Mahtab, informing him of Rahul Gandhi’s appointment.\n","\n","Congress Working Committee Resolution\n","The Congress Working Committee had resolved on June 8, shortly after the Lok Sabha election results, to appoint Rahul Gandhi as the Leader of the Opposition. The resolution praised his contributions to the party’s campaign, particularly through the Bharat Jodo Yatra and Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, which many saw as pivotal in reviving the party’s fortunes.\n","\n","Reluctance and Acceptance\n","Although initially hesitant, Rahul Gandhi eventually accepted the role, encouraged by his mother Sonia Gandhi and sister Priyanka Gandhi. Congress President Kharge humorously warned him of disciplinary action if he did not comply with the Committee’s decision.\n","\n","First Constitutional Role\n","This will be Rahul Gandhi’s first official constitutional role, despite his long tenure in Parliament since 2004. During the UPA rule from 2004 to 2014, party leaders urged him to take a Cabinet position, but he declined. Gandhi’s public image has evolved significantly, particularly following his extensive Bharat Jodo Yatra, which played a crucial role in boosting the Congress’s seat tally in the latest elections.\n","\n","Impact on Congress and the Opposition\n","Rahul Gandhi’s appointment as the Leader of the Opposition will strengthen Congress’s position and the broader opposition alliance. The INDIA bloc, which includes major parties like the Samajwadi Party, Trinamool Congress, and DMK, aims to challenge the BJP’s dominance in the Lok Sabha.\n","\n","This strategic positioning
